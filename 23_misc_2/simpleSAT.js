// Looks fun

// Decode Boolean logic formulas such as "(a&b)|c", see if any combinations of inputs can make it true.

// First thought: Trick to use binary numbers to check all combijnations of inputs... nice...

// But we could have indefinitely nested parens... Hm.... some kind of recursion would make more sense...

// This is the kind of problem I struggle with..
