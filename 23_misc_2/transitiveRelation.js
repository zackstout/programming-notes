// WHOA

// Since you are looking at a a matrix representation of the relation, an easy way to check transitivity is to square the matrix.
// The relation is transitive if and only if the squared matrix has no nonzero entry where the original had a zero.
// (If you don't know this fact, it is a useful exercise to show it.) â€“

// Oh wow, yeah, I kind of forgot about matrix powers as representing the number of walks..... Damn yeah that is cool
